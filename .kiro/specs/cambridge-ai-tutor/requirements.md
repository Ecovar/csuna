## Introduction

The Cambridge AI Tutor is an integrated digital platform designed to support parents and primary school children following the Cambridge curriculum. The platform addresses the challenge of limited parental time and subject knowledge by providing AI-powered educational support across Mathematics, English as a Second Language (ESL), and Science. The solution consists of a web application, Chrome extension, and mobile/tablet applications that work together to create a comprehensive learning ecosystem.
