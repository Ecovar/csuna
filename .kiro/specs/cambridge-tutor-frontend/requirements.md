# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Cambridge AI Tutor Frontend Implementation project focuses on transforming the existing Suna AI interface into a child-friendly, educational platform specifically designed for Cambridge primary curriculum learning. This project will replace the current general-purpose AI assistant interface with specialized components that cater to children aged 5-12 and their parents, providing an engaging, safe, and educationally-focused user experience.

The frontend transformation will leverage the existing backend infrastructure while creating new React components, layouts, and user flows that align with educational best practices and child safety requirements. The interface will support both child and parent user roles, with distinct experiences tailored to each user type's needs and capabilities.
