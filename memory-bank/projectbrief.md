# Project Brief: Cambridge AI Tutor

## Project Overview

The Cambridge AI Tutor is an integrated digital platform designed to support parents and primary school children following the Cambridge curriculum. The platform addresses the challenge of limited parental time and subject knowledge by providing AI-powered educational support across Mathematics, English as a Second Language (ESL), and Science.

## Core Problem Statement

Parents with limited subject knowledge struggle to support their children's Cambridge curriculum learning outside school hours. This creates a knowledge gap that can hinder children's academic progress and confidence.

## Solution Vision

A comprehensive learning ecosystem consisting of:

- **Chrome Extension**: Context-aware help for educational websites
- **Mobile/Tablet Apps**: On-the-go learning with offline support
- **Unified Backend**: AI-powered tutoring with curriculum alignment

## Key Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Bridge Knowledge Gap**: Enable parents to support learning regardless of their subject knowledge
2. **Personalized Learning**: Adapt content to each child's learning pace and style
3. **Curriculum Alignment**: Ensure all content aligns with Cambridge primary standards
4. **Multi-Platform Access**: Seamless learning across web, mobile, and browser extension

### Success Metrics
- AI response time under 3 seconds
- Curriculum alignment validation for all content
- Cross-platform data synchronization
- Child safety and privacy compliance (COPPA/GDPR)
- Parent satisfaction with learning support capabilities
